#+TITLE: Switch monitor for Floodlight

This script runs a simple monitor that checks the transfer rates of each link of every OF switch in a Floodlight controlled SDN.

* Usage

** Dependencies

Install the dependencies with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

** Execution

The script relies on the =FLOODLIGHT_BASEURL= environment variable to find the controller API. Assuming the controller is running on the same host as the scipt, export the base URL as such

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export FLOODLIGHT_BASEURL='http://localhost:8080'
#+END_SRC

... then start the monitor

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python main.py
#+END_SRC
